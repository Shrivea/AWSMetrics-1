aws.lamba.Invocations,gauge,,,,"Invocations – The number of times your function code is executed, including successful executions and executions that result in a function error. Invocations aren't recorded if the invocation request is throttled or otherwise resulted in an invocation error . This equals the number of requests billed.",,lambda,
aws.lamba.Errors,gauge,,,,"Errors – The number of invocations that result in a function error. Function errors include exceptions thrown by your code and exceptions thrown by the Lambda runtime. The runtime returns errors for issues such as timeouts and configuration errors. To calculate the error rate, divide the value of Errors by the value of Invocations . Note that the timestamp on an error metric reflects when the function was invoked, not when the error occurred.",,lambda,
aws.lamba.DeadLetterErrors,gauge,,,,"DeadLetterErrors – For asynchronous invocation , the number of times Lambda attempts to send an event to a dead-letter queue but fails. Dead-letter errors can occur due to permissions errors, misconfigured resources, or size limits.",,lambda,
aws.lamba.DestinationDeliveryFailures,gauge,,,,"DestinationDeliveryFailures – For asynchronous invocation, the number of times Lambda attempts to send an event to a destination but fails. Delivery errors can occur due to permissions errors, misconfigured resources, or size limits.",,lambda,
aws.lamba.Throttles,gauge,,,,"Throttles – The number of invocation requests that are throttled. When all function instances are processing requests and no concurrency is available to scale up, Lambda rejects additional requests with TooManyRequestsException . Throttled requests and other invocation errors don't count as Invocations or Errors .",,lambda,
aws.lamba.ProvisionedConcurrencyInvocations,gauge,,,,ProvisionedConcurrencyInvocations – The number of times your function code is executed on provisioned concurrency .,,lambda,
aws.lamba.ProvisionedConcurrencySpilloverInvocations,gauge,,,,ProvisionedConcurrencySpilloverInvocations – The number of times your function code is executed on standard concurrency when all provisioned concurrency is in use.,,lambda,
aws.lamba.Duration,gauge,,,,Duration – The amount of time that your function code spends processing an event. The billed duration for an invocation is the value of Duration rounded up to the nearest millisecond.,,lambda,
aws.lamba.PostRuntimeExtensionsDuration,gauge,,,,PostRuntimeExtensionsDuration – The cumulative amount of time that the runtime spends running code for extensions after the function code has completed.,,lambda,
aws.lamba.IteratorAge,gauge,,,,"IteratorAge – For event source mappings that read from streams, the age of the last record in the event. The age is the amount of time between when the stream receives the record and when the event source mapping sends the event to the function.",,lambda,
aws.lamba.ConcurrentExecutions,gauge,,,,"ConcurrentExecutions – The number of function instances that are processing events. If this number reaches your concurrent executions quota for the Region, or the reserved concurrency limit that you configured on the function, additional invocation requests are throttled.",,lambda,
aws.lamba.ProvisionedConcurrentExecutions,gauge,,,,"ProvisionedConcurrentExecutions – The number of function instances that are processing events on provisioned concurrency . For each invocation of an alias or version with provisioned concurrency, Lambda emits the current count.",,lambda,
aws.lamba.ProvisionedConcurrencyUtilization,gauge,,,,"ProvisionedConcurrencyUtilization – For a version or alias, the value of ProvisionedConcurrentExecutions divided by the total amount of provisioned concurrency allocated. For example, .5 indicates that 50 percent of allocated provisioned concurrency is in use.",,lambda,
aws.lamba.UnreservedConcurrentExecutions,gauge,,,,"UnreservedConcurrentExecutions – For an AWS Region, the number of events that are being processed by functions that don't have reserved concurrency.",,lambda,
